  Week 1 vertical slice: Pico button press → Hue group command

  Goals:
  - Connect to Lutron bridge via LEAP
  - Receive button press events
  - Send group command to Hue bridge
  - Measure end-to-end latency
  - Document quirks and constraints

  This is throwaway exploration code. Hardcoded values are fine.
