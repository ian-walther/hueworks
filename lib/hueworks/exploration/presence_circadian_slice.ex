  Week 2 vertical slice: HA presence → Z2M circadian lighting

  Goals:
  - Subscribe to HA presence sensor via WebSocket
  - Calculate appropriate color temp for current time
  - Send command to Z2M lights via MQTT
  - Track manual override detection
  - Test state reconciliation

  This is throwaway exploration code. Hardcoded values are fine.
